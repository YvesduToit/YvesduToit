- 👋 Hi, I’m @YvesduToit
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics software development. 
     Well actually I really enjoy the bio-devops side of bioinformatics and the deployment of systems to the working environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning while I work to deploy Flask based web applications.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything.
